Here’s a concise roadmap for building a stable, proven 3D FPS on Ubuntu 24.04 using battle-tested tools and techniques.

At a high level, you’ll:

* **Core Language & Framework**: Use C++ for performance and maturity, paired with SDL2 for cross-platform windowing, input, and basic audio ([libsdl.org][1]).
* **Rendering API**: Rely on OpenGL for decades of hardware support and stability ([en.wikipedia.org][2]) ([khronos.org][3]).
* **Math & Shaders**: Employ GLM for GLSL-style math in C++ and write shaders in GLSL ([github.com][4]).
* **Physics**: Integrate Bullet Physics SDK for real-time collision and rigid-body simulation ([github.com][5]).
* **Audio**: Use OpenAL-Soft for 3D positional audio ([github.com][6]).
* **Assets & Tools**: Model and UV‐map with Blender; export textures as PNG (alpha via libpng) ([github.com][7]).
* **Build & CI**: Orchestrate builds with CMake and automate testing/deployment via GitHub Actions or Jenkins ([wiki.libsdl.org][8]).
* **Version Control**: Track all code and assets in Git for collaboration and rollback.

## Programming Language & Core Framework

### C++

C++ remains the industry standard for high-performance game engines due to its control over memory and CPU resources.
Using **SDL2** provides a thin, stable abstraction for window creation, input (keyboard, mouse, controllers), and basic audio/file I/O; it’s widely used in commercial titles ([libsdl.org][1]) ([stackoverflow.com][9]).

---

## Graphics: Rendering & Shaders

### OpenGL

OpenGL is a mature, cross-platform graphics API supported on virtually all GPU hardware, making it a low-risk choice for Linux game development ([en.wikipedia.org][2]) ([khronos.org][3]).
It uses GLSL for shader programming, which maps directly to GPU pipelines and enjoys extensive tooling support (e.g., RenderDoc, gDEBugger).

### Math Library

**GLM** mirrors GLSL types and functions in C++, simplifying matrix and vector math without runtime dependencies ([github.com][4]).

---

## Input Handling

Leverage SDL2’s input subsystem to capture keyboard, mouse, and gamepad events with minimal platform-specific code ([libsdl.org][1]).
SDL2’s event queue and polling model ensure deterministic input processing.

---

## Audio

### OpenAL-Soft

OpenAL-Soft is the reference Linux implementation of OpenAL and provides 3D positional audio with proven performance in many engines ([github.com][6]) ([forums.thedarkmod.com][10]).
For even higher-level abstraction, consider SDL\_mixer on top of SDL2 for simpler sound effects and music playback.

---

## Physics Simulation

**Bullet Physics SDK** offers real-time rigid-body dynamics, collision detection, and soft-body simulation in a single, well-maintained C++ library ([github.com][5]) ([gamedev.stackexchange.com][11]).
Its modular design lets you plug in custom collision shapes and integrate seamlessly with your rendering loop.

---

## Asset Creation & Management

### 3D Modeling

Use **Blender** (open source since 2002) for modeling, UV unwrapping, and animation; export assets as FBX or COLLADA for broad engine compatibility ([github.com][7]).

### Textures

Store diffuse/normal/specular maps as PNG to preserve alpha channels for effects like decals or UI sprites (handled by libpng in your loader).

---

## Build System & Continuous Integration

### CMake

CMake is the de facto cross-platform build system generator, supported by CLion, VS Code, and command-line tools on Ubuntu ([wiki.libsdl.org][8]).

### CI/CD

Automate builds/tests with **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**: run unit tests, validate shaders, and package nightly builds for QA.

---

## Version Control & Collaboration

**Git** is indispensable for tracking code and art assets, enabling branching for features, pull requests for reviews, and safe rollbacks.

---

## Packaging & Distribution

On Ubuntu, package your game as a `.deb` or use **Flatpak**/Snap for sandboxed, easy installations across distributions.
Include a launcher script that sets necessary environment variables (e.g., `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` if targeting older hardware).

---

By combining these decades-proven components—C++ → SDL2 → OpenGL/GLSL → GLM → Bullet → OpenAL → Blender → CMake/Git—you’ll establish a rock-solid foundation for your 3D FPS on Ubuntu 24.04.
